          <p>Please provide a list of design elements alongside their justifications:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Colour scheme:&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;</em>
<ul class="list-unstyled">
            <li>
              <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #8F7E62;"></span>
              #8F7E62
              <em>The light brown signifies comfort.</em>
            </li>
            <li> <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #4C3921;"> </span> #4C3921 <em>The dark brown  signifies comfort.&nbsp;</em> </li>
			  <li> <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #F3B23F;"> </span> #F3B23F <em>The mustard yellow signifies adventure.</em> </li>
			  <li> <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #95A387;"> </span> #95A387 <em>The green&nbsp;signifies safety and nature.</em> </li>
            <li>&nbsp;</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Font choices:</strong>&nbsp;The font used for the headings as well as the body text&nbsp;  is Pangolin, a rounded and handwritten-style typeface that adds a personal, approachable feel to Campher’s branding. Its slightly playful curves and informal touch evoke warmth and authenticity, the key to building a trusting and safe environment for solo female travelers. Pangolin reflects empowerment with softness, embracing the balance between strength and approachability that defines Campher’s personality. Pangolin’s handwritten look also complements the brand’s emphasis on community and shared experiences. Overall, Pangolin   reflects Campher’s core values: safety, comfort,  empowerment and nature, wrapped in a warm, minimalistic visual language .</li>
            <li>The Campher website uses clean and intuitive design patterns that contribute to a smooth and user-friendly experience. A fixed horizontal navigation bar is positioned at the top of the page, providing quick access to key sections such as Experiences, Safety Tips, and Corporate. Keeping navigation consistent across the site minimizes confusion and makes it easier for visitors to explore content without feeling lost.

The overall layout follows a grid-based structure, creating a clear sense of visual order. On the home page the content is organized into well-defined sections, like the “About Us” text next to the logo, or the login form placed alongside the vision statement. This type of layout helps users naturally group related content and understand the hierarchy of information on the page.

A large image carousel is used across the homepage and “Experiences” section to visually communicate the brand’s atmosphere. These images do more than decorate, they immediately establish a sense of calm, freedom, and empowerment, which are key aspects of Campher’s identity. Carousels also serve a functional purpose, allowing multiple visuals to be displayed without overwhelming the user.

Interactive components such as the login box, chat button, and testimonial comment sections keeps interactive areas clean, focused, and easy to use. These elements clearly guide users toward meaningful actions, like signing up, asking for help, or sharing their experiences. The visual language of the website is carefully aligned with Campher’s values and personality. The use of a soft, earthy color palette creates a natural and calming atmosphere, reflecting the brand’s connection to nature and its focus on comfort and safety. Rounded typography and smooth design elements contribute to a welcoming tone, which supports the brand’s message of accessibility and inclusiveness.

Important values like Safety, Nature, Community, and Easy Access are not only embedded in the site’s content but also visually highlighted in their own section. This reinforces the message that these aren’t background ideas, they’re central to what Campher offers. The site design also complements the brand’s marketing and communication goals. It invites engagement through clearly placed calls to action, such as “Join the community” and “Start a chat”. Using real testimonials makes the website feel more genuine and helps build trust, especially for an audience that values community and shared experiences.

The website's clear structure also leaves room for future content, such as workshops, product features, or brand partnerships, without needing to change the design. 

This design helps Campher stand out as more than a resource, it becomes a companion and guide for women entering or continuing their solo traveling journey.</li>
            <li>The CampHer Safety Tips page has a clean, user-centered layout. Using Bootstrap’s grid system, the page creates an intuitive and responsive two-column layout, text and images balanced side-by-side, enhancing readability and engagement.</li>
			  <li>Navigation structure follows a horizontal navigation bar pattern, which ensures quick access to core pages: Home, Experiences, Safety Tips, and Corporate.</li>
              <ul>
				  <li>From a branding perspective, the website supports CampHer’s identity as a community-driven, safety-first platform for solo female campers. The color scheme (warm earth tones), rounded images make the page feel approachable and empowering. The use of the Pangolin font adds a touch of personality, aligning with the brand's mix of comfort, care, and individuality.</li>
				  <li>In terms of marketing and communication, the page is structured to guide users through a funnel. For instance, after providing detailed safety tips, the final call-to-action (“Join our community”) appears with standout coloring. This leads users engage without aggressive persuasion.</li>

          <h4 id="production-3" class="mt-2">Testing Report</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>The primary goal of our testing is to evaluate how effectively the website communicates its purpose and supports the needs of our target audience: solo female travelers interested in camper van adventures. We want to understand whether users can easily navigate the site and access important features such as safety information, campsite suggestions, and community spaces. Additionally, we aim to assess if the visual design and overall tone of the website create a sense of trust, empowerment, and comfort. Finally, we hope to identify any usability issues or moments of confusion that could restrict the overall user experience, so we can refine and improve the platform accordingly.</li>
            <li>To evaluate the usability and visual coherence of our website prototype, we conducted a user testing session with four participants. Three of them aligned well with our target audience: independent, safety-conscious women interested in van travel. One participant, although male and therefore outside our core demographic, still provided valuable insights from a UX (user experience) perspective, which we found extremely helpful in refining functionality. The testing took place on campus in a casual, focused setting, where participants were asked to interact with our paper-based prototype of the Campher website. We provided clear instructions, asking them to share their thoughts and impressions out loud while exploring the site. We guided them to reflect on key aspects such as content clarity, navigation flow, accessibility, and visual appeal. These sessions were audio recorded to ensure we could review their feedback in detail later. Overall, the responses were very positive, confirming that our design direction resonated with users. However, one participant made a particularly insightful observation: she suggested that the navigation bar (originally designed as a hidden vertical menu) would be more intuitive and user-friendly if placed horizontally and kept visible at all times at the top of the page. We took this feedback seriously and implemented the change to improve the overall navigation experience.

This testing phase confirmed that our website design is not only aligned with our brand’s values of safety, ease, and empowerment, but also responsive to the real needs of our users.

          <h2 id="marketing" class="mt-5">Marketing</h2>
          <h4 id="marketing-1" class="mt-2">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
          <p>The Campher campaign was designed to promote a safe, empowering space for solo female van campers. The message focused on normalizing solo travel for women, while emphasizing safety, preparation, and confidence. The aim was to engage and connect with Gen Z and Millennial women by using digital storytelling and community interaction across key platforms. Our promotional activities were primarily executed on Instagram and Facebook, based on audience research from our Communication Media Plan. These platforms were chosen because they are where our audience is most active and engaged, particularly when it comes to lifestyle, travel, and wellness content. The campaign included regular feed posts twice a week (Tuesdays and Fridays), and daily Instagram stories featuring behind-the-scenes content, safety tips, polls, and interactive elements.&nbsp;The objectives, as outlined in our Communication Media Plan, were to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Reach at least 400 Instagram profiles;</li>
            <li>Receive 20+ likes per post with a few meaningful comments;</li>
            <li>Start building a loyal and interactive community;</li>
            <li>Consistently post 2x per week and maintain daily story activity.</li>
          </ul>
<h4 id="marketing-2" class="mt-4">Learning Points</h4>
          <p>Throughout the project, we gained valuable insights into social media marketing, particularly within a niche audience. One of the key takeaways was that growing a following takes more time and strategy than expected. Even though we stayed consistent with posting and maintained strong visual branding, overall engagement (likes, comments, shares) was lower than we anticipated. On the positive side, our message and visual identity were clear and well-received. Users who came across our content understood Campher’s mission and appreciated the tone and purpose. However, it became clear that visibility alone is not enough, relying only on  posts didn’t generate the reach or interaction we hoped for. If we were to do it again, we would combine  posts with more active outreach, including influencer collaboration, paid ads, and more interactive formats. We also realized the importance of creating content that encourages users to participate, not just consume.</p>
          <h4 id="marketing-3" class="mt-4">Future Planning</h4>
          <p>If the project were to continue, our next step would be to expand reach and boost engagement using a more strategic approach. Based on our experience and what we learned, we would:</p>
			<ul>
			  <li>Collaborate with influencers and vanlife communities to gain trust and improve visibility within our niche;</li>
			  <li>Use paid promotions on Instagram and Facebook to target a wider and more specific audience;</li>
			  <li>Shift content from purely informative to a more interactive mix including polls, quizzes, user-generated content, and safety-related challenges or prompts;</li>
			  <li>Create short-form video content (e.g. Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts) to present safety tips in a fun, shareable, and relatable format;</li>
			  <li>Partner with outdoor brands (e.g. camping gear, travel safety companies) for cross-promotions and giveaways to increase interest and credibility.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4 id="marketing-4" class="mt-4">Professionalism</h4>
          <p>All of our campaign content was developed with care to reflect Campher’s brand identity. The images used in feed posts and on the site are high-quality, consistent in tone, and visually aligned with our earthy, nature-focused palette. Our posts maintained strong readability and coherence, using fonts and layouts that matched the brand's friendly and professional voice.</p>

          <h2 id="management" class="mt-5">Management</h2>

          <h4 id="management-1" class="mt-2">Lean Canvas</h4>
			  <li>Our Lean Canvas has three versions the link to which can be found in the Appendix, which also includes explanations. The first version was based on our initial assumptions about the target group.After making the intial interviews, link to which can also be found in the Appendix, we adjusted the lean canvas to better match our audience and that is reflected in the second version. The third and final version of the Lean Canvas is based off of the site testing interviews, which can also be found in the appendix. During those interviews the participants were given tasks to go through the initial version of the website. Here you can find a picture of our final version.</li>
			  <img src="images/finalleancanvas.jpg" class="img-fluid my-3" alt="Lean Canvas Visual">
			  

          <p class="fw-bold">Problem</p>
          <ul>
<ol>
  <li>On the final Lean canvas, we present seven problems of our target audience. To begin with, our interviewees stated that there is not enough verified sources that show secure and well-reviewd camping sites. Currently, they try to find places like that by searching for reviews online and seeing the ratings. It helps sometimes but in cannot be trusted completely.</li>
  <li>Another issue for our target group is the lack of built-in, female-focused security tools or campground infrastructure. There are not enough camping spots provided with security, which raises concern about outside people coming to the camp. The lack of built-in security tools in the van itself is also a problem, as it makes it harder to secure the van by themselves. That problem also connects to the theft concerns and inadequate ventilation. In case the weather is too hot, there are concerns about leaving windows open at nigh, as fear of theft ad break-in arise.</li>
  <li>There were multiple complains about limited emergency communication options during travel. Sometimes, connectivity may be lost, which would be a big problem for the campers in case of an emergency and no emergency services being close enough. The lack of tracking devices that work in those cases seemed to be a big problem.</li>
	<li>Finally, all of those problems contribute to stress that is stopping the campers to enjoy the moment to the fullest.</li>
</ol>           
			  <li>Current alternatives for women interested in solo camping include  blog posts, general camping apps, and social media communities. However, these sources often lack credibility, verified safety information, and a focus on the specific needs of female travelers. While platforms like Google Maps and national park websites do provide campsite details, they do not cater specifically to the concerns and safety priorities of solo female campers.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Solution</p>
          <ul>
            <li>We focused on providing foursolutions for our target group, the first one being acurated platform with a verified database of safe campsites, parking areas, and emergency services. That resolves the problem of not being able to trust sites like GoogleMaps and Blog posts.</li>
            <li>Second of all, we decided to provide the users with a growing network where users can share real-time safety updates, ask questions, and receive expert advice from experienced solo travelers tailored for solo female travelers.</li>
			  <li>After conducting the initial interviews we found out that weapons and violence in case of a problem may backfire so we decided to give them uides on non-violent safety strategies like decoys, alarms, lighting etc.</li>
			<li>Finally, we made a community chat to locate and connect with other female campers nearby, which resolves the fear of isolation and fear of unknown people at night.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Customer segments</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Our main targeted age groups are Millennials and Gen Z women who love nature, camping, and road travel.Solo female travelers who prioritize independence, safety, and sustainable travel practices.</li>
            <li>Our ideal users are tech-savvy, eco-conscious, and safety-aware women.
